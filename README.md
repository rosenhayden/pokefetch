![Alt text](240514_19h45m26s_screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot of terminal")

simple 2 hr project that makes a neofetch style program. The program loads a unicode pic of the pokemon passed and loads some basic stats from a pokemon api. I fully stole the ideas an assets from https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts
